I liked Albert York

Quote at the end of A Realer Real, an essay about Laurie Parsons
"the purity of intent you couldn't achieve before is now yours. And, you know, whatever"

Essay about Cady Noland - Freedom's just another word
"if the game is corrupted, don't play, or at least don't let their standards become yours"
"artists dont have to have long careers. A starburst can be enough"

From an essay abotu Trisha Donelly, and wrapping up the book
"just because you *can* funnel something through speech acts doesn't mean you're obliged to. There are register  s of experience other and perhaps grander if more oblique and knotty than that, even if uncongenial to our post-Conceptual art world."
