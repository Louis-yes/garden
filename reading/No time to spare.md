Ursula Le Guin

"in any case, war is something humans do and show no signs of stopping doing, and so it may be less important to condemn it or to justify it than to be able to percieve it as tragic."

But anger nursed and nourished begins to act like anger suppressed: it begins to poisoinn the air with vengefulness, spitefulness, distrust, breeding grudge and resenment, brooding endlessly over the causes of the grudge, the righteousness of the resentment. A brief, open expression of anger in the right moment, aimed at its true target, is effective - anger is a good weapon. But a weapon is appropriate to, justified only by, a situation of danger.
