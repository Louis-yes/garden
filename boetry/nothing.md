I feel frustration or sadness or an inability to grasp 
the ostensible richness and depth of my life

My circumstance so dissapointingly plainly written, the exact result of the function of my experiences, handed the same arguments you would expect nothing different. The unsurprising mannerisms, the self fulfilling lack of confidence, the justified but not really worth noting depression, the anxiety characteristic of everybody my age.

The complete flatness of my being, and the frustration of so few similar flat friends so far between, exasperated by my flaw of always leaving.

Where is the eternal I see in art? In other people's relationships? Why can I see it in myself like a light on the wall, cast by an unseen flame? Unseen, through the window, somewhere far off in the sky, completely removed from my location, and always removed.

A pile of candies the weight of a late lover, ruins me. The intimacy to know the weight, to know the body as onesown. I haven't loved or felt loved in so long. I don't even know what I want.
