You can write your first poems  
thinking you might as well  
since the most stupid people in the universe  
are writing their five hundredth here.  
I'm doing that now. What  
difference does it make.  
I like my poems. They're  
as good as rocks.

[As Good as Anything by Alice Notly](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/58192/as-good-as-anything) 

A well put reminder that something is usually better than nothing, and the consequence of an average result is still better than inaction
